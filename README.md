## Problem Statement :



Traditional financial institutions often have stringent requirements for loan approvals, making it difficult for individuals with low credit scores or limited financial history to obtain loans. Additionally, these institutions may charge high-interest rates and fees, further limiting access to affordable credit. This project aims to address this issue by creating a peer-to-peer money lending platform that connects borrowers with lenders directly, without the need for intermediaries, providing fair and affordable access to credit for all.

## Solution :

The peer-to-peer money lending web application developed using the Tech stack (PHP,MySQL and JavaScript) will allow borrowers to connect with lenders directly through an online platform. Borrowers will be able to submit loan applications, and lenders will be able to view and select the loan applications they wish to fund. The platform will use advanced algorithms and credit scoring models to match borrowers with lenders based on their creditworthiness and other relevant factors. The platform will also allow for secure and efficient payment processing, automatic repayment schedules, and loan tracking. Additionally, the web application will have a user-friendly interface that enables easy registration, profile creation, and communication between lenders and borrowers. The application will also have robust security features, such as encryption of user data, to ensure the safety of sensitive information. Overall, this peer-to-peer money lending web application will offer an innovative and accessible solution to the challenges faced by borrowers and lenders in the traditional financial system.
    
   *  Loan applications: Borrowers will be able to create loan applications by providing relevant personal and financial information, such as income, credit score, and loan amount. The platform will use this information to calculate the borrower's risk profile and assign a corresponding interest rate. 
   *  Lender selection: Lenders will be able to view loan applications and select those that they wish to fund. Lenders will be able to see the borrower's credit score, risk profile, and loan amount, among other information, to make informed decisions. 
   *  Credit scoring model: The platform will use advanced credit scoring models to assess the borrower's creditworthiness. These models will take into account a range of factors, such as income, employment history, and credit history, to assign a credit score to each borrower.
   *  Payment processing: The platform will have a secure and efficient payment processing system that will allow borrowers to receive funds and lenders to receive repayments automatically. The system will support multiple payment methods, such as credit card payments and bank transfers. 
   *  User interface: The web application will have a user-friendly interface that will allow borrowers and lenders to create profiles, communicate with each other, and track loan progress. The interface will also allow for easy navigation and browsing of loan applications. 
   *  Security features: The web application will have robust security features, such as encryption of user data and multi-factor authentication, to ensure the safety of sensitive information. The platform will comply with relevant data protection regulations and industry standards to maintain the highest levels of security.
